What is Cypher?
Cypher is a graph query language that is used to query the Neo4j Database. Just like you use SQL to query a MySQL database, you would use Cypher to query the Neo4j Database.

Write a query to retrieve all the movies released after the year 2005. </br>
Match (m:Movie) where m.released > 2005 RETURN m

Write a query to return the count of movies released after the year 2005. (Hint: you can use the count(m) function to return the count) </br>
